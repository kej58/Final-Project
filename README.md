### Summary:

In order for a neighborhood to be named 'the best', it must meet certain expectations. For this assignment we set these expectations as: Low Crime Rate, High Number of Faclities, and Lots of Public Schools. These are some metrics that would make a neighborhood more desireable to live in than others. With low crime rate, it shows that civilian's lives would be safe and they would not always have to worry about being robbed or broken into. With a high number of facilities such as shelters, pools, concessions and firehouses, the neighborhood would have plenty of resources. It would also make the people's lives more fun and entertaining with lots to do around them. Lastly, with a high number of public schools, children would have lots of differnt options to get an education and their parents would not have to worry about them not having that opportunity. After looking through each individual data set, we noticed that Brighton Heights qualifed all three metrics with solid numbers. It contains 14 facilities, 22 public schools, and only had 59 police cases reported in the last 30 days. These are great numbers, and Brighton Heights dserves to be the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh according to our metrics.
